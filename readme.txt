The exam creation process involves designing an assessment by selecting questions based on their categories and types. Here's how this can be outlined clearly:

1. Define Question Categories and Types:
Categories:
Questions are divided into three difficulty levels:

Low: Easier questions, generally straightforward or based on basic concepts.
Medium: Moderate difficulty, requiring a deeper understanding or problem-solving ability.
High: Challenging questions that require advanced knowledge or complex problem-solving.
Types:
Questions are divided into two main types:

Objective: These include multiple choice, true/false, or other fixed-answer formats.
Subjective: These require written responses, such as essays or long-form answers.
2. Exam Creation Process:
When creating an exam, the following steps are followed:

Step 1: Define Total Number of Questions
The exam creator defines the total number of questions to include, distinguishing between Objective and Subjective.
Example: "The exam will consist of 30 Objective questions and 5 Subjective questions."
Step 2: Define Question Breakdown by Difficulty
The creator specifies how many questions of each difficulty level will be included.
Example: "The 30 Objective questions will be split into 10 Low, 10 Medium, and 10 High difficulty questions."
Step 3: Question Fetching
The system fetches questions from a pool based on the difficulty and type criteria.
Objective Questions: The system selects 30 questions from a pool of 90 available Objective questions, ensuring the right balance of difficulty.
Subjective Questions: The system selects 5 questions from a pool of 20 available Subjective questions, again balancing difficulty.
Step 4: Randomization (Optional)
Depending on the system's settings or preferences, the questions may be randomized, either in terms of:
Question Selection: Randomly selecting questions from each category of difficulty.
Question Sequencing: Randomly ordering the questions within the exam.
Step 5: Final Exam Creation
The final exam consists of a specific number of Objective and Subjective questions, chosen according to the defined categories (difficulty levels and types).
In Summary:
Question Categorization: Questions are classified by difficulty (Low, Medium, High) and type (Objective, Subjective).
Exam Creation: The creator sets the total number of Objective and Subjective questions, and the system selects the appropriate questions based on the defined difficulty levels. The exam can also be randomized, depending on system preferences.
